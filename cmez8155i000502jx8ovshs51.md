So, why learn assembly when you have lanagues like python, java and c++?

There are some reasons you should learn assembly language, like getting to know how the computers work. The higher order langauges abstract almost everything and that is a good thing but it comes with a cost and that is less customization/optimization. In most cases people who have developed the language have done very good job and things are very optimized but there are certain specific situaitons where you must get let go of the abstrations of the higher languages.

The goal of learning assembly lanauge is not productivity but understanding that comes with it. Although there are a few industries that use assembly languages like: embedded systems, aerospace industry, semiconductor manufactuerers.

The purpose here is to get you started with the assembly language, if you are reading this it is most likely that you are required by your school to take this course or in rare cases struck with the inspiration to learn it.

We will use the intel processors as they are the most used and there are enough resources and communities to help you if you get stuck. Initially, We will start with 16-bit architecture, these days the most common used architecutres are either 32-bits or 64-bits(most computers these days). When 16-bit arch came out there were very less security problems, so it lacks security features but that makes it simple for our purpose of understanding assembly lanaguage.

lets say you write some code it will be convereted to source code(that will be assembly ) then it will be convereted to binary.

## Setup

we will use dosbox for emulating a 16-bit architecture machine.

1. Install dosbox locally on your machine, wsl will work too, if you havenâ€™t [setup wsl](https://mattzaskeonline.info/blog/2024-04/getting-started-wsl-quick-installation-guide) you should set it up before running the following code.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install dosbox
    ```
    
2. Run dosbox
    
    ```bash
    dosbox
    ```
    
    this command will open this window:

    Now, we need the compiler for our assembly, will will use a version of MASM(Microsoft Macro Assembler), you need to download the zip file and extract it into a folder(i have named it learn\_assembly you can change it to your liking).
    

```bash
mkdir learn_assembly # create a new folder
cd learn_assembly    # go into that folder
sudo apt install git -y  # install git if not installed already
git clone https://github.com/Umer-Islam/assm_zip.git # download the zip file from github
mv assm_zip/assmsoft.zip . # move the zip file to learn_assmebly/
sudo apt install unzip -y # download and install unzipper if not already installed
sudo unzip assmsoft.zip # unzip the file
rm assmsoft.zip # remove the zip file after extraction.it just takes storage
```

you should see the following files in your directory:

```bash
ls
```

4. now run the dosbos again and mount the folder we just setup:
    

```bash
doxbox
```

mount the folder we created to c drive, type the following in your dosbox:

```bash
mount c ~/learn_assembly # mount into c drive
c: # go into c drive
```

```bash
dir
```

this command should show the following:

5. we are ready to write assembly.
    
6. create a new assembly file and compile it:
    
    1. write the following command in cli of your host machine(your linux machine not dosbox cli)
        
        ```bash
        touch hello-world.asm
        sudo apt install vim -y
        ```
        
        paste the following code:
        
        ```bash
        [org 0x0100]
        
        ; code from here
        
        mov  ax, 11              ; move the constant value of 11 into register ax 
        mov  bx, 50               ; same as above with different value
        
        
        mov  ax, 0x4c00         ; exit 
        int  0x21               ; interupt
        ```
        
        compile this code in doxbox:
        
        ```bash
        nasm hello-world.asm -o hello-world.com
        adf hello-world.com
        ```
        
7. writing hello world is very complicated, so we will use the debugger to make sure that our code works.

    One thing to remember is that everything is in Hex or Hexadecimal for the ease of understading and it takes less space on screen.
    
    Now, you are ready to write some assembly. Go to the next article in series to learn more.

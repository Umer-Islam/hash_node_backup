when you try to view all the packages installed in your project by using the command:

```bash
dotnet list package
```

and get the following error:

```bash
Unable to read a package reference from the project `C:\reallyLongListOfDirectories\jwt_auth\jwt_auth.csproj`.Please make sure that your project file and project.assets.json file are in sync by running restore.
```

Solution:

simply delete the file:  
obj&gt;project.assests.json

after deleting the file run the following command:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

```bash
dotnet list package
```

This usually solves the problem, in case it doesnâ€™t work. Please make sure of the following:

1. Your local server should NOT be running.
    
2. Your project is configured properly.
    
3. If a package is being added, it can cause the error wait for a moment and try again.
